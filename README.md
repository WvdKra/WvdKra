- 👋 Hi, I’m @WvdKra
- 👀 I’m interested in performance testing and engineering. I like to look at networktrace files and discover what goes over the wire or through the air.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bit of Java programming and tools around automations pipelines
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things in the mix of performance, networktraces, automation.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
